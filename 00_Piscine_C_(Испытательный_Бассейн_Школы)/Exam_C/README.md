# C Test Pool Exam Tasks #



The exam includes 75 problems divided into 6 levels of progressive difficulty, numbered from 0 to 5. Level 0 tasks are as simple as `only_a`, in which the symbol "a" is printed on standard output, while Level 4 and 5 tasks are as complex as `flood_fill`, `ft_itoa_base` and `print_memory`. By completing each task correctly, you move up one level, and therefore increase the difficulty of the ass.

Topics covered include string manipulation, bitwise operations, memory allocation, sorting algorithms, simple data structures, linked lists, and basic conversions. Some of these assignments may be from the project exercises, and others may be completely new.

Solutions must be completed by the program in less than 10 seconds; no other optimization is required.



# About taking exams in the classroom at School 42

Exams take place every Tuesday morning from `9:00 to `13:00 in the School 42 building. Students log into a special exam account with limited access to applications and the Internet and take the test using a word processor(`Sublime Text', `vim',`emacs'), `git' and a proprietary terminal application called `examshell'.

Students are given one question at a time, starting the test at level 0. For each correct solution, they are awarded points and move to the next level of the test, up to a maximum of level 5.For each incorrect solution, students are given another problem of the same level, but the number of points they can earn at the current level is reduced by 5. Up to 16 points can be earned at each of levels 0 through 4 and above. Up to 20 points can be earned at level 5. The maximum number of points possible for an exam is 100 points.

Students must score at least 75 points in order to receive credit for the exam. To pass the exam and qualify for the next level, the average of the top 5 attempts should be at least 75 points for the beginner level or 84 for intermediate. 

# How and where to write code on the exam in the School 42 classroom

You can use `Sublime Text', `vim' or `emacs' during exam 42! However, there is one important limitation: you should not use the `Open File', `Save As' or, for unnamed files, `Save File' dialog boxes. If you do this, your computer will crash. Instead, open and save files as follows:

* Create files by typing in the terminal:

		touch filename1 filename2 filename3

* Open files in Sublime Text by typing in your terminal:

		open -a "Sublime Text" filename1 filename2 filename3

* Alternatively, to open a Sublime Text window with a sidebar to navigate to files with the root in the current directory type:

		open -a "sublime text" .

* Save changes to the existing file using âŒ˜S or File-> Save as usual. Just make sure the file already exists, otherwise the "Save" dialog box will appear and your computer will crash!
